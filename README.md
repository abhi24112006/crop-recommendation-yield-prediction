🌾 Crop Recommendation & Yield Prediction System (India)
📌 Overview

This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning system that recommends the top 3 suitable crops for cultivation and predicts the expected yield based on agricultural and environmental factors relevant to Indian farming conditions.

The system combines classification and regression models, wrapped inside an interactive Streamlit web application for real-time predictions.

🎯 Problem Statement

Farmers often lack data-driven guidance on:

Which crops are best suited for their region and season

What yield they can realistically expect under given conditions

This project aims to:

Recommend optimal crops based on input conditions

Predict expected yield to support better planning and decision-making

🧠 System Architecture

The system uses two separate ML models:

1️⃣ Crop Recommendation Model

Type: Multiclass Classification

Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier

Output: Top-3 recommended crops (probability-based ranking)

2️⃣ Yield Prediction Model

Type: Regression

Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor

Output: Expected yield for each recommended crop

Both models share a unified preprocessing pipeline.
